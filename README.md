# ping-pong-js
A minimal ping pong game with HTML Canvas and JavaScript

To run locally you need to deploy the website on a server. There are many small options like:

- VSCode Live Server Extension (It does all the work for you...)
- Python http module: You can simply navigate to the folder where you cloned the project and then run this command
```
python -m http.server 8080
```
The app will be in `localhost:8080`

- Node.js server: This will require some coding but if you know some javascript you will be fine.
